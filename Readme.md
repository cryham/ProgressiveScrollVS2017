CryHam: My fork has changes for smaller and separated marks, details in [my commits](https://github.com/cryham/ProgressiveScrollVS2017/commits?author=cryham).


This is a fork of ProgressiveScroll updated to work with VS 2017, original fixes [here](https://github.com/akaStiX/ProgressiveScrollVS2017).


**About**

It replaces the scrollbar with a graphic representation of the code (1 pixel per character).

It also shows bookmarks, find matches, breakpoints, errors and change marks (on margin).


**Features**

* Double clicking highlights the selected word in the editor and the scrollbar. Pressing Escape clears the highlights.
* Coloring options for whitespace, comments, strings, file changes, highlights, bookmarks, breakpoints and errors. These are in Tools > Options > Fonts and Colors, names begin with Progressive Scroll.
* Adjustable width and other settings under Tools > Options > Progressive Scroll).

Warning! Does not work well with word wrap.
